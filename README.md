# 🧪 LocalStack-Powered AWS Integration Tests

A minimal, production-ready example of **AWS service testing in CI/CD** using:
- **LocalStack** — lightweight AWS cloud emulator
- **boto3** — official AWS SDK for Python
- **GitHub Actions / GitLab CI** — fully automated pipelines

Test AWS workflows (S3 uploads, DynamoDB writes, Lambda triggers, etc.) **100% offline**, with zero cloud spend.
